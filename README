Description:

This plugin parses all desktop-files to assemble a desktop's
applications menu and display it with the vdr's OSD.

The selected app is started via a helper script "starter"
which must be located in the plugin's conf-directory.
It gets the full path to the selected desktop-file.

Build Dependencies:

libgnome-menu is known to have an unstable API.
So this plugin may not compile with all versions.
